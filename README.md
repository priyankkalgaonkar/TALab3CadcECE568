# Lab 3 - Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) Experiment 
## Introduction
This project configures the ADC to perform single conversions, by default this is performed using a 16 bit configuration. The code uses ADC0, channel 12, once the conversion is finished it is displayed at the serial terminal. Note that the ADC0 inputs are not connected to anything of interest at thistime, but are just demonstrated to function.

Replace the default code with the code in "main.cpp" from this GitHub repo by creating an empty project OR clone the GitHub code in to your Keil Studio Cloud IDE (recommended).

## Dependencies
- NXP FRDM K64F development board
- Keil Studio Cloud IDE
